Unit tests for the centralized Layer-1 visibility helpers in ``mcpgateway.auth_context``.

``get_scoped_resource_access_context`` is the single derivation point for the Layer-1
admin-bypass + public-only-secure-default rule that route handlers in ``main.py`` used to
copy inline. Endpoint tests mock this helper and assert only that the handler forwards its
result, so the rule itself is pinned here.

Contract under test:

- ``(email, None)``  - admin bypass. ``user_email`` is deliberately preserved so the service
  layer can still owner-match the admin's own private rows.
- ``(email, [])``    - public-only token (also the secure default for non-admins).
- ``(email, [...])`` - team-scoped token, passed through unchanged.
