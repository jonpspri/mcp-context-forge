Regression tests for ICA20-1559.

Callers (e.g. ICA's ContextForgeMcpGatewayImpl.createMcpTeam) that retry team creation for a team
whose ICA->CF mapping was lost hit an active same-slug collision in ContextForge. Previously this
leaked an IntegrityError and surfaced as an opaque 500 {"detail":"Failed to create team"}, which
ICA could not recover from. After the fix, the colliding POST is rejected with a clean, catchable
400 instead of 500. These tests lock that HTTP contract end-to-end through the real router and a
real database.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Waiver: concurrent-race (flush IntegrityError) backstop is NOT covered at the
# integration level — by design, not omission.
#
# The backstop (team_management_service.create_team_with_members, the
# `except IntegrityError` around `self.db.flush()`) can only fire when two fully
# concurrent in-flight transactions BOTH pass the active-slug pre-check before
# either commits. `email_teams.slug` is globally unique across active and
# inactive rows, so a single sequential request can never make the pre-check
# miss a row that the later insert collides with — the two statements observe
# the same rows absent real concurrency.
#
# Reproducing that true race here would require real multi-worker/threaded
# concurrency against the SQLite + StaticPool + single-TestClient harness this
# file uses; SQLite write-locking makes such a test inherently non-deterministic
# and flaky, which would be worse than no test.
#
# The backstop is therefore covered deterministically at the unit level by
# `test_team_management_service.py::test_create_team_flush_integrity_error_becomes_conflict`,
# which forces the flush IntegrityError and asserts it surfaces as a clean
# TeamNameConflictError (routed to 400/409). The race is closed by the same DB
# unique constraint the sequential 400/409 tests above already prove end-to-end.
